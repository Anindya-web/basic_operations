#Explanation:
# This Python code snippet is performing basic arithmetic operations on two numbers provided by the user. Here's a breakdown of what each line does:
# This line of code is prompting the user to enter a value for `num_1` by displaying the message
# "Enter the value of num_1: ". The `input()` function takes the user's input as a string. 
# The `float()` function then converts this input string into a floating-point number (decimal number) and assigns it to the variable `num_1`.
